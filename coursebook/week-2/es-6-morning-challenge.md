## ES6 - Morning challenge

### ESwhat??

ES5 is a name for the version of JavaScript that we all know and love. It's
[supported very well](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) in reasonably modern browsers, and is probably what you've been using
upto now.

ES6 (ES2015) is an updated version of the JavaScript standard, released in 2015. It's
a superset of ES5 - nothing is removed, but exciting new features have been added.
[ES6 support](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) isn't great in older browsers (and IE11) so it's used in the back-end rather than the front-end (although you can use tools such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert ES6 to ES5 for you).

### The Challenge

We're going to be converting ES6 features to their ES5 counterparts.
Bear in mind there are some differences in functionality between them, which the links in
the [morning challenge instructions](https://github.com/GSG-G10/mc-es6-challenge) should help you to understand. You may want to focus on
understanding some of the main differences rather than rushing to the end as
this will help you to start using ES6 in your own Node projects.

Clone the [Morning challenge: Convert ES6 code to ES5](https://github.com/GSG-G10/mc-es6-challenge) repository to your computer and follow the instructions.

A completed solution is saved in the solutions directory of the repository, but try to work it out yourself first – it's not a race, and you shouldn't worry if you don't manage to complete everything.
